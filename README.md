# RealPass
Is your password **_strong_** or just **_wrong_**? A free and open source program to test your password against realistic and real-world scenarios.

RealPass is a free and open source password testing tool that uses realistic and real-world scenarios to evaluate the strength of your passwords.

## Features

- Uses advanced algorithms and attack simulations to estimate how long it would take an attacker to guess your password.
- Can run on a variety of platforms, including GPUs, to maximize its performance.
- Includes a dictionary of common passwords to check against.
- Allows you to specify custom dictionaries and attack methods.

## Installation

To install RealPass, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [RealPass releases page](https://github.com/Verisimilitude11/realpass/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded archive.
3. Run the `install.sh` script (or `install.bat` on Windows) to install RealPass.

## Usage

To use RealPass, run the `realpass` command and specify the password you want to test. For example:

```pwsh
$ ./RealPass-x64 mypassword
```


RealPass will then evaluate the password and display the estimated time it would take an attacker to guess it. It will also provide suggestions for improving the strength of your password.
